### Silders

- elasticity:
  Defines how bouncy the next created ball will be. Values rage from 0 to 100 with 0 having the elasticity of a rock and 100 of Monkey D. Luffy
- gravity:
  Defines how fast the balls will fall down. Values range from 0 to 100 with 0 meaning balls will just stop in mid air and 100 being normal gravity

### Levels

Make a ball touch a red platform, while avoiding blue ones
